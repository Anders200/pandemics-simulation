# Setting up the project

To run the projects make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed.
PyCharm and other sophisticated IDEs will probably configure this automatically (probably).

1. Create a virtual environment (make sure that you are in the same folder as this file in your terminal)

-   python -m venv ./venv

2. Enter the virtual environment in the terminal. This may differ on windows. Check python virtual environments guide on the internet if this doesn't work.

-   source ./venv/bin/activate

3. Install required packages. You should see (venv) at the start of the line in terminal.

-   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Now you can run python files normally, but make sure to be inside the virtual environment! E.g.

-   python SIR_simple.py
